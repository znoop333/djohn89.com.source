    <strong>Abstract: Building Webapps to Help You Build a Jeep</strong>
<br>
<br>Historically, automotive plant operators received part numbers and VINs in printed formats to run production line (including sub-assembly lines, e.g., sequencing and kitting). These "broadcasts" or build sheets were temporarily attached to cars and quickly discarded upon vehicle completion. In contrast to the traditional printouts, this talk will introduce mobile webapps as an effective way to replace paper printouts and provide vital production information quickly and efficiently. Videos of an automotive plant assembly line will illustrate how operators receive and use information from both the original paper and new webapp formats.
