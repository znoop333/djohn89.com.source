    I've written a number of C++/MFC programs using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365683%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">overlapped I/O approach</a>, and it has always been a real pain. Even MSDN doesn't really seem to like it:

<br>
<br>The problem with doing asynchronous I/O with OVERLAPPED function calls like ReadFileEx is that you have to be extremely careful with how you design your program to continue executing with a callback function or by waiting on an EVENT handle to get signaled. The callback function requires dealing with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/29/168719.aspx">alertable states</a>, which is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/02/02/10123392.aspx">really error-prone</a>.Â  No, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/02/02/10123392.aspx">seriously, don't do it </a>because dealing with the re-entrancy can drive you nuts. Alertable wait states are terribly hard to reason about because it is the non-GUI analog to pumping messages (c.f. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/03/589110.aspx">Raymond Chen</a>).
<br>
<br>So I recently started using IOCP for the same purposes, and I'm happy to report that it works much better! I guess that shouldn't be a surprise because it's <a href="http://www.flounder.com/iocompletion.htm">been recommended by some excellent programmers</a>. Anyway, here's the rough idea of how I got it to work for me:
<br><ol>
<br>	<li>Create a background thread with an IOCP handle.</li>
<br>	<li>Open a file (or socket, serial port, etc.) with OpenFile and associate it with the IOCP.</li>
<br>	<li>Initiate I/O using ReadFile (not ReadFileEx).</li>
<br>	<li>Handle <strong>both synchronous and asynchronous</strong> completion of the I/O.</li>
<br></ol>
<br>That last point was the hardest for me to realize that I absolutely have to deal with synchronous, immediate completion of the I/O (not just asynchronous completion from the IOCP). So you really do have to check the return value from ReadFile and also GetLastError() == ERROR_IO_PENDING.
<br>
<br>IOCP is so good that it is <a href="http://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/11/there-is-no-thread.html">the basis for C#'s multi-threading I/O</a>. The designers of C# must not have even cared about the old ways to do I/O (e.g., waiting on events, alertable callbacks with APCs, OVERLAPPED callback functions, etc.).
