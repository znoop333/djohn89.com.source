    I will be presenting a talk called "<span style="color: #ff00ff;">SQL Server Notifications in a manufacturing environment</span>" at the annual FoxCon Toledo Software Developers Conference, Feb 7-8, 2015. Unfortunately, there isn't a website for FoxCon, but Bob Ruple is the organizer. I will post my slides on this website after the conference has started.
<br>
<br>Abstract:
<br>
<br>Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Queries that poll a database looking for changes can waste tremendous amounts of network bandwidth, CPU, and other precious database server resources. By changing the structure of your SQL client to use query notifications rather than polling, you can reduce computational load on both the client and the server. We'll review the mechanism of asynchronous queuing in Microsoft SQL Server, and then we'll examine a case study of how it can be implemented in an automotive assembly plant. Examples of notifications include routine vehicle brake line leak testing and real-time detection of robot failures.
