    <h2>RTA Lightning talk: Cloud Storage Tips and Tricks</h2>

<p>
I did a lightning talk (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VE0TVMYTwUrtr5pdn-PTKo0n4U22kuwTO-vP8Yjd5Iw/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slides</a>) about cloud storage at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/research-triangle-analysts/events/288690973/">a meeting</a> of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/research-triangle-analysts/">Research Triangle Analysts</a>.
</p>

<p>Summary: If you know a little about how cloud storage works, you can optimize the speed and cost efficiency of using it.</p>

<p>Don't mix hot and cold storage. Read seek speed should dominate your decisions about cost.</p>
