    I had a very good time at FoxCon 2015. The other speakers were very good, and I was happy with how my presentation went. I can't say there was much Visual FoxPro code on display, but I learned about many other new and interesting technologies.
<br>
<br>Anyway, here's a link to my slides (<a href="/uploads/2015/02/FoxCon2015-Johnson-Notifications.pdf">FoxCon2015-Johnson-Notifications</a> PDF).
<br>
<br>Edit: I forgot to include a link to the Youtube video that I showed, "<a href="http://youtu.be/sTbaTmfMaPA"><span id="eow-title" class="watch-title " dir="ltr" title="Jeep   Toledo North Assembly Complex">Jeep Toledo North Assembly Complex,"</span></a> by Automotive Zone.
