    It's time for <a href="http://www.codemash.org/">CodeMash</a> again. I'm looking forward to learning new things and getting outside my comfort zone, with respect to programming languages and new frameworks. Last year I tried to get familiar with Node.js and microservices. This year, I'm trying to go to more of the functional programming and machine learning talks. I'm somewhat sad thatÂ Stephen Cleary doesn't have a presentation this year, and neither do I. I guess the reviewers want a wider variety of presenters, as the acceptance rate was under 20% and there are a lot of new presenters.
<br>
<br>Anyway, we'll see how it goes. Time to mash some code!
