    <h2>Book review - I'm feeling lucky: the confessions of Google employee number 59</h2>
<p>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Im-Feeling-Lucky-Confessions-Employee/dp/0547416997">I'm feeling lucky: the confessions of Google employee number 59</a> by Douglas Edwards (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, July 2011). ISBN: <a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/978-0547416991">978-0547416991</a>.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p> "I'm feeling lucky" (IFL) covers the internal discusssions of Google's early days (until and including the 2004 IPO) from the perspective of a marketing expert who felt marginalized by the engineering-centric culture. IFL's high points include discussions of strategic decisions about competing search products and explanations about how end-users can relate to Google's customer-facing products. The less interesting parts of the book are the frequent personality clashes with other famous Googlers of the time and vague descriptions of (allegedly) salacious events, e.g., office romances and booze-filled retreats. Mr. Edwards had a minor role at Google, and his outsized ego probably exaggerates his contributions. </p>

<p>Overall rating of the book: 4 out of 5 stars. Worth reading for the strategic decisions.</p>
