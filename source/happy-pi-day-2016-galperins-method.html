    This year for Pi Day, I have a demo of π's <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/138289/intuitive-reasoning-behind-pis-appearance-in-bouncing-balls">appearance in bouncing balls</a>, also known as <a href="http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~cfgg/">Galperin</a>'s method due to a paper published in 2003 (Playing Pool with π (the Number π from a Billiard Point of View", Regular and Chaotic Dynamics, V. 8, No 4, 2003). Here is <a href="https://youtu.be/4UhPTrHIprk">a youtube video</a> demonstrating the phenomenon:

<br>
<br><a href="https://youtu.be/abv4Fz7oNr0"> Numberphile also produced a video about it</a>, and the NY Times Blog also <a href="http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/?_r=0">gave a different derivation</a>.
<br>
<br><a href="https://reducedplanckconstant.wordpress.com/2012/07/29/brilliant-billiard-balls-pi-from-the-pool/">Here's a link discussing the math</a>.
<br>
<br>Basically, conservation of momentum and conservation of energy produce a system of equations that reduce down to stating that the the cosine of the number of collisions will change from positive to negative at an integer equal to [10^N*π], so the number of collisions will produce digits of π!
