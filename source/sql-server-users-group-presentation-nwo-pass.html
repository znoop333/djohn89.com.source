    I was pleased to present my talk, SQL Server Notifications In A Manufacturing Environment, again for the <a href="http://nwo.sqlpass.org/Home.aspx?EventID=3856">Northwest Ohio SQL PASS Chapter</a>. I removed the C# code and replaced it with information relevant to a database administrator - what a Query Notification looks like inside SQL Server, how it affects other clients, etc. The revised slides are linked here <a href="/uploads/2015/09/Johnson-Sep-2015-NWO-PASS-SQL-Server-Notifications.pdf">Johnson Sep 2015 NWO-PASS-SQL Server Notifications</a>. I also made some printed handouts with a summary of the talk - <a href="/uploads/2015/09/handouts-for-NWO-PASS-July-2014-Meeting.pdf">handouts for NWO-PASS Meeting</a>.
<br>
<br>The turnout was pretty good, and I got a lot of interesting questions. The most frequent question seems to be about how the Query Notification interacts with transactions, which I addressed in my slides. To summarize the answer: a QN becomes part of the transaction that fired it, so if that transaction rolls back, so does the QN. It's not really much different than how the actions of an INSERT/ UPDATE/ DELETE database trigger become part of another transaction.
