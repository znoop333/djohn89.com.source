    Operators use torque tools to build a car with nuts and bolts, but what happens when the tools themselves have problems? In this presentation Dave will examine a case study of how preventative maintenance and quality inspection can be improved by using machine learning to model the failures observed on the assembly line.Â  Learn how Bayesian prediction (frequently used in email spam filters) can be applied to predict and identify these failures before they occur.
