<br>Presented at FoxCon Toledo Software Developers Conference, Toledo, OH, on 1/27/2018.
<br>
<br>Abstract:
<br>
<br>Electronic torque tools used in automobile production produce a large amount of data as workers and robots physically assemble a vehicle. This data includes alarms and errors for various potential defects such as rehit bolts, cross-threaded bolts, incorrectly removed bolts, failure to achieve torque within engineering specifications, etc. In his presentation David will reveal how an analysis of this data can yield new insights into the causes of operator errors and solutions in new quality auditing systems, both on and off the production line.
