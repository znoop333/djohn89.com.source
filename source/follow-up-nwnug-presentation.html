    I was very pleased to repeat my presentation, "<span style="color: #ff00ff;">SQL Server Notifications in a manufacturing environment,</span>" (PDF download link: <a href="/uploads/2015/02/NWNUG-2015-SQL-Server-Notifications-in-a-manufacturing-environment.pdf">NWNUG-2015</a>) at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NW-NUG/">NWNUG meeting</a>. As before, here is a link to the Youtube video that I showed, "<a href="http://youtu.be/sTbaTmfMaPA"><span id="eow-title" class="watch-title " dir="ltr" title="Jeep   Toledo North Assembly Complex">Jeep Toledo North Assembly Complex,"</span></a> by Automotive Zone.
<br>
<br>I am continuing to edit my slides and refine the core messages of the presentation, and I will be presenting it a third time at <a href="http://www.fanug.org/">the FANUG next week</a>.
<br>
<br>Thank you again to NWNUG, Jason Follas, and Bob Ruple for these opportunities to present my work.
