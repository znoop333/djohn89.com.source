    <h2>Research Triangle Analysts Analytics&gt; Forward 2019</h2>
<br>
<p>According to their website, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Research-Triangle-Analysts/">Research Triangle Analysts (RTA)</a> is a "math user" group for data enthusiasts in the Research Triangle. Their annual bar camp-style conference (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Research-Triangle-Analysts/events/258165094/">Analytics&gt; Forward 2019</a>) was great. I didn't find out about it soon enough to prepare a talk, but I learned some useful things from attending presentations at it. There was minimal organization: no set schedule, no abstract reviews, no published proceedings, no website, etc. However, for only $12 and a short drive, it's really hard to argue with the efficiency of this type of conference. Also, since the attendees directly voted on the 1-minute pitches, it's also a more democratic form of reviewing than abstract commitees (albeit maybe less effective at identifying the best or worst ones, since the pitches didn't necessarily reflect the contents of the full 50-minute presentation).</p>
<h3>Statistical inference with Buzz and Doris</h3>
